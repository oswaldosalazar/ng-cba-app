# CbaApp

The objective of this project is to help parents and students of the CBA obtain information on the upcoming activities related to The Nutcracker production. Originally, the CBA staff provides parents with a booklet guide that contains detailed information about cast members, scenes, and performance dates. The parent's guide presents data written in Word and Excel, so the parents have to flip through pages to look for their individual pertinent information. With the use of a relational database, I was able to present the relevant upcoming activity for a single student.

Moreover, with the use of persistent data, a logged in user can save the name of a specific student to get even easier access to individual information.

The front-end of this application, deployed in Firebase, uses Angular2. The back-end uses Express and PostgreSQL in a Heroku server.
